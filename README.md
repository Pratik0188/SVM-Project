# SVM-Project

This project works to detect if the cancer cells are malignant or beningn . We use a machine learning algorithm; Support Vector Machine(SVM) to detect the severity of the cancer cells. The dataset used for the project is imported from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign.
